Welcome to my blog and my "first" post, and I say it with quotes since it's not really my first blog post but instead, my first blog post on eversoul.

Because I don't really have anything special to say, the main purpose of this post is simply to welcome everyone to my blog, but hey, I tried:).

Anyway, I think you already know the objective of this website since it's written on the [front page](/); thanks for reading until the end and have a nice day, stranger!

(Oh, and thanks for keeping indieweb and neocities alive!)
