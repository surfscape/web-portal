The purpose of this document is to give a reason of existence to the SurfScape Project. This includes our mission, goals, and actions to accomplish our purpose.

SurfScape mission is to show how much power the free, corporateless, community supported web has.

To accomplish this, we serve a community, free services, and an open source portal for everyone that is interested in taking back the web and create their own place free of greed and non sense.

We show that everything is possible and that everyone has a voice to share their opinions independent on their incapacities or creativity.

We also belive that privacy is an important human right and we should fight back on corporations that take us back the control of our own data.

SurfScape is built by the community for free, for everyone that wants to take back the web. If you agree with us and want to fight back, [join us](/community)!
